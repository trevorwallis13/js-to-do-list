# JavaScript To-Do List

Use a form to add new items and due dates to a to-do list. Each item has the option to delete or mark complete.

When you mark an item as complete, it moves to the Completed Tasks lists. You can uncheck the complete box to move it back to the active tasks list. 

Delete button removes a task. 

## A note

This was my first project that I made from start to finish, including all the HTML and CSS.
